# LtAmpGUI
Creating a GUI for interacting with a Fender Mustang LT amp, using the work of [brentmaxwell](https://github.com/brentmaxwell) in their repository [LtAmp](https://github.com/brentmaxwell/LtAmp)

## Roadmap
I will be trying to figure out how to create a GUI for a .NET application, using Electron.NET?, so that the GUI can be easily edited in a simple format.
